Machine Learning Resgression Project

# **Problem Statement**
The project's goal is to analyze a dataset of 100,000 news articles and their social feedback on platforms like Facebook, Google+, and LinkedIn over an eight-month period from November 2015 to July 2016. The objective is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and build machine learning models to predict a news article's popularity on these platforms 48 hours after publication. The dataset includes articles on four topics: Economy, Microsoft, Obama, and Palestine. The project aims to provide insights and predictions that can help content creators and news organizations optimize their strategies.
